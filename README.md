# Git Bloggin


## Description

[Deployed Application](https://git-bloggin.herokuapp.com/)

Messaging forums and blogs have gone mainstream. In today's world, it's tough to find an internet user who doesn't read or contribute to a forum or blog. When we're talking about the world of coding and computer science, it's even more rare to find a software developer who doesn't utilize the resources of something like reddit or stack overflow. Git Bloggin was created to provide developers with a new place to ask questions, get answers, create tutorials, etc, without the extra bells and whistles that clutter up popular landing pages like stack overflow.

Tired of outdated posts? Not interested in all the extraneous things that stack overflow and reddit force upon you? Ready to level up your coding knowledge and build community with fellow devs? Then Git Bloggin is the blog space for you! Get the support you seek with a simple and easy to user interface to quench your blogging and forum needs. Git Bloggin let's you post, edit, and delete threads and comments, while giving you a clean UI comparable to reddit (if reddit ever decided to add more colors to their webpage).

If you are interested in improving or modifying this application for your own personal usage, please go ahead and clone down the repository and transform it into your own amazing Forum or Blogging Website!
